# Introduction

## Project Abstract

This document proposes a real-time multiplayer game application based on the classic party game "Mafia" that combines interactive gameplay with several dynamic features. The system allows Users to connect and participate via WebSocket connections between a React-based frontend client and a backend Node.js server. Upon joining, the first player is designated as the Host with unique capabilities. Upon game start, each player is randomly assigned a unique role such as "Mafia" or "Citizen" from a pre-defined pool; the roles have different win conditions and strategy. The players go through a series of Day and Night voting phases to eliminate players and eventually determine a winning team.
